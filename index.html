        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
         I'm currently a computer science student majoring in Cyber-security and Data Science.<br>
         In my free time away from the screens I like.... to go back to the screens and learn or<br>
         write more code. That's not a lie, but outside of computers I love being active in <br>
         particularly I'm a runner. Nothing beats a few hours on the road watching the sunrise<br>
         with absolutley no ne around.
        </p>
        <p>
        I enjoy traveling and food, Especially traveling for food! I have lived outside country of<br>
        my home country for several years where I could not speak the language. I learnt alot of <br>
        personal skills in this time, mainly communication, how to adaptive on the fly and how to <br>
        function while being uncomfortable.
        </p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        

        <p>It is hard trying to remain anonymous and give information simultaneously...<br>
            During my time studying Audio, I worked under stage managers on main stages <br>
            at major festivals. These were small teams that had to make lots of decisions in <br>
            a high paced environments, needless to say, I love it, having to think fast <br>
            on your feet to solve problems while a show is being performed live were rewarding <br>
            experiences.
            </p>

            <p>That's all for now.</p>
